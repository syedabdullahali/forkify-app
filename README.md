# 🍴 Forkify App

The **Forkify App** is a simple and interactive web application built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** that lets users search for meal recipes and explore cooking instructions.

### 🚀 What Does It Do?

* Users can **search for recipes** (like "pasta", "chicken", etc.)
* App fetches data from an online recipe **API**
* Users can view recipe details like ingredients and cooking time
* Includes an option to **order a meal** (demo feature only)
* Supports **Dark Mode / Light Mode** for a better user experience
* Smooth and dynamic UI updates using a custom **virtual DOM-like approach**

---

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* **JavaScript** (with ES6 Classes and Functions)
* **HTML5**
* **CSS3**
* **Fetch API** for getting data from the internet
* Custom-built **Virtual DOM** (similar to React) for efficient rendering

---

### 🧠 What is Virtual DOM (in simple words)?

In this project, I created a mini version of how **React** updates the screen.
Instead of changing everything on the page, the app checks **what really changed** and updates **only that part**. This makes the app **faster** and **smoother** — just like how React works behind the scenes.

### 💡 Why I Built This

To improve my understanding of:

* API handling using JavaScript
* DOM manipulation and performance optimization
* Creating cleaner, reusable code using classes
* Real-world frontend app structure and logic
